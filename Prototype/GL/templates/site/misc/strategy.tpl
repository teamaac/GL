<h4>Our Strategy</h4>
<p class="blue">
	<p>
		<b>Loose coupling</b><br/>
		A fundamental goal of Django’s stack is loose coupling and tight cohesion. The various layers of the framework shouldn’t “know” about each other unless absolutely necessary.
		For example, the template system knows nothing about Web requests, the database layer knows nothing about data display and the view system doesn’t care which template system a programmer uses.
		Although Django comes with a full stack for convenience, the pieces of the stack are independent of another wherever possible.
		<br/></br>
		<b>Less code</b></br>
		Django apps should use as little code as possible; they should lack boilerplate. Django should take full advantage of Python’s dynamic capabilities, such as introspection.
		<br/></br>
		<b>Quick development</b></br>
		The point of a Web framework in the 21st century is to make the tedious aspects of Web development fast. Django should allow for incredibly quick Web development.
