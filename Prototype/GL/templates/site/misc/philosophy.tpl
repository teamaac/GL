<p class="blue">KISS & DRY</p>
<p>
	<b>DRY:</b><br/>
	Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY, also known as Once and Only Once or Single Point of Truth (SPOT)) is a process philosophy aimed at reducing duplication, particularly in computing.
	The philosophy emphasizes that information should not be duplicated, because duplication increases the difficulty of change, may decrease clarity, and leads to opportunities for inconsistency.
	DRY is a core principle of Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas's book The Pragmatic Programmer.
	<br/><br/>
	<b>KISS:</b><br/>
	KISS principle is a colloquial name for the empirical principle that simplicity is an essential asset and goal in systems and (industrial) processes.
	It is popular in software, animation and engineering in general.
